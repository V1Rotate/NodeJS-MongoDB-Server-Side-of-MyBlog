This is the server-side of MyBlog project. Future MERN project.

Technologies used so far: NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, as well as Bcrypt, Jsonwebtoken and Express-validator for user authentification.
During the development process I used MongoDB Compass and Insomnia for HTTP requests.

This server-side of the project is not complete yet. To be completed as soon as possible.
